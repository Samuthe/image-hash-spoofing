Documentation for Image Hash Spoofing Script

This script provides tools to compute an image file's hash, append random data to an image, and spoof an image hash to match a given prefix.
Overview

This script performs the following tasks:

    Computes the SHA512 hash of an image file.
    Appends random bytes to the end of an image file.
    Iteratively modifies an image file until its hash matches a specified prefix.

It is designed to experiment with hash collisions while keeping the image visually unchanged.
Functions
1. compute_hash(file_path, algorithm='sha512')

Description: Computes the cryptographic hash (default: SHA512) of an image file.

Parameters:

    file_path (str): Path to the image file.
    algorithm (str): Hashing algorithm. Only sha512 is implemented.

Returns:

    str: Hexadecimal hash of the file.

Example:

hash_value = compute_hash('image.png')
print("Hash:", hash_value)

2. append_random_data(file_path, output_path, length=16)

Description: Appends random bytes to the end of a file.

Parameters:

    file_path (str): Path to the original file.
    output_path (str): Path to save the modified file.
    length (int): Number of random bytes to append. Default: 16.

Returns:

    None (modifies the file).

Example:

append_random_data('original.png', 'modified.png', length=16)
print("Random data appended.")

3. spoof_image(prefix, input_image, output_image, max_attempts=1000)

Description: Modifies an image file by appending random bytes until the file's hash starts with the given prefix.

Parameters:

    prefix (str): Desired hexadecimal prefix for the hash.
    input_image (str): Path to the original image file.
    output_image (str): Path to save the spoofed image.
    max_attempts (int): Maximum number of modification attempts. Default: 1000.

Returns:

    None (prints results to console).

Example:

spoof_image('99', 'original.png', 'spoofed.png')

Output:

    Success: Image spoofed successfully in X attempts.
    Failure: Failed to spoof image within max attempts.

Usage Example

To spoof an image so its hash starts with a specific prefix:

    Place the original image file (e.g., original.png) in the working directory.
    Run the script:

    python3 script.py

    Check the spoofed.png file for the modified image.

Dependencies

    Python 3
    Modules:
        hashlib: For computing cryptographic hashes.
        os: For appending random bytes to files.
        Pillow (optional): For image handling (PIL).

Install Pillow (if needed):

pip install pillow
